* [Introduction Video][video]
* [Project Site][site]

### What's the difference?

*   **Neovim Support**
*   Merged some reasonable [pull requests][upstream-pr] which made to upstream

#### What's your further plan?

*   Merge more reasonable pull requests
*   Make faster
*   Automated test

#### Do you have any plan to diverge from [upstream][]?

*   Not yet. It'll always be downstream of original

### Requirements

    <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; *or*<br>
    [Neovim][]

*   Python ≥ *2.4*
